Pressing the Save button will write to the file Map.RSM (this will overwrite the current Map.RSM file).\
Reset will clear your current map and fill it with tile 1 at the current size.\

Faster testing of changes to the map can be achieved by merging the folders. If prompted to replace files, select replace. In my testing it doesn't matter what folder you merge to or if you select replace as all shared files are identical.
